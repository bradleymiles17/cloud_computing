# COMSM0010: Birdception

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the COMSM0010 Cloud Computing Submission.

Code for the image classifier is based upon a tutorial found here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-deep-learning-models-with-aws-lambda-and-tensorflow/

Please feel free to test it, example images have been included. Be aware that Birdception only supports .jpg images.

Thank you,

Bradley Miles and Spencer Warren
